Use "ant -projecthelp" (no quotes) to get a list of valid targets.  Also be sure
to check that the build.properties file contains valid values for your local
environment and if it doesn't you'll need to create a user.properties file in
the same directory which you can use to make workspace specific overrides that
won't be propagated to other user's environments.

Also note the intellij project expects you to have defined within your IntelliJ
installation a special kind of JDK named "IDEA_SDK".  You can create this
special JDK by going to the same location where you would define your other
locally installed JDKs but then select the "IntelliJ IDEA SDK" option instead
of the standard "JSDK" when given the choice.
